# Gomoku

**Gomoku**, or Go-moku or Five in line, is a traditional oriental game, originally from China. In Japanese language *Go* means five, and *moku* pieces (or eyes or dots).

Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Here the Java implementation of this game is implemented. We provide the user 3 different implementations of Gomoku (Standard, Omok and Freestyle) and 3 different opening rules (Standard, Swap and Swap2). Each implementation has different rules and can be read in the file "GomokuRules.pdf". 

The structure of the project follows the pattern [Model](https://github.com/michelaventurini96/Gomoku3/tree/master/src/main/java/Model)
